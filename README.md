# Electron application example

This example shows how you can use Next.js inside an Electron application to avoid a lot of configuration. It uses the Next.js router as view and server-render to speed up the initial render of the application.

For development it's going to run an HTTP server and let Next.js handle routing. In production it uses `output: 'export'` to pre-generate HTML static files and uses them in your app instead of running an HTTP server.

**For detailed documentation about how to build Electron apps with Next.js, see [this blog post](https://leo.im/2017/electron-next)!**

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-electron with-electron-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-electron with-electron-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-electron with-electron-app
```

You can create the production app using `npm run dist`.
